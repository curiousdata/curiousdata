## 🔍 Focus Areas

- 🌍 **Geospatial & Earth Observation ML**  
  Modeling land and environmental processes using remote sensing datasets (e.g., IberFire, GHSL, WorldPop, NetCDF)

- 🔥 **Climate Risk Prediction**  
  Forecasting wildfire risk using spatiotemporal modeling and PyTorch

- 🌐 **Connectivity & Infrastructure Analytics**  
  Predicting school internet access across developing countries with broadband datasets (M-Lab, Ookla)

- ☁️ **Cloud-Based ML Pipelines**  
  Experience with Azure ML, Databricks, Docker, and MLflow for scalable, reproducible workflows
